# Migration Guide

## From Monolithic to Modular Architecture

### Before Migration
- Single main.py file with 1300+ lines
- Mixed concerns (API, business logic, UI)
- Hard to test and maintain

### After Migration
- Modular structure with clear separation
- Easy to test individual components
- Scalable and maintainable

### Steps Completed
1. ✅ Created modular directory structure
2. ✅ Extracted code into separate modules
3. ✅ Updated imports and dependencies
4. ✅ Created configuration files
5. ✅ Added Docker support
6. ✅ Created test structure

### Next Steps
1. Run tests: `pytest tests/`
2. Start services: `docker-compose up`
3. Access dashboard: http://localhost:8000
